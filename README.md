# Santander-Customer-Transaction-Prediction

Overview
This project is part of my learning journey in machine learning. Inspired by the Kaggle competition "Santander Customer Transaction Prediction," the goal is to predict which customers will make a specific transaction in the future. The competition's challenge is a binary classification problem, providing a valuable opportunity to apply and deepen my understanding of data science techniques.

Learning Objective
The primary purpose of this project was educational. Throughout this process, I aimed to:

Understand the end-to-end data science workflow: from data loading and exploration to preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
Learn from the best: I studied and adapted techniques from publicly available notebooks and resources to ensure I followed industry best practices.
Apply theoretical knowledge: I implemented various models and techniques learned during my studies, focusing on understanding their practical applications.

Project Details
Problem Statement
Santander Bank aims to identify customers who will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the transaction amount. This is a typical binary classification problem where the goal is to accurately predict whether a customer will make a transaction.

Dataset
The dataset was provided as part of the Kaggle competition. It includes a training set with labels indicating whether a transaction was made and a test set where predictions are to be made. These data can be accessed through the Kaggle competition page.
